## Kanka Keybinds

Attaches a listener to entity pages and responds to a small number of new hotkeys.

### L (label)

Opens a popup auto-suggest against the campaign's tags. 

Selecting a tag applies it to the current entity. If the tag is already present, it removes it instead.

Does not support creating new tags.

### M (move)

Opens a popup auto-suggest against the campaign's locations. 

Selecting a location sets the current entity's location to that value. If the entity type supports multiple locations, it adds to the collection.

### ? (help)

[not implemented]

Opens a modal showing this content.
